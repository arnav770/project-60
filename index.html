        <p>1. The Checklist Manifesto by Atul Gawande
"A quick and illustrative book that shows just how powerful well-designed and properly implemented checklists can be in reducing mistakes in all kinds of fields. I've been on many mountaineering adventures where your life depends on a good checklist to make sure ropes, harnesses, and equipment are properly set up. Not everything in life needs a checklist, but we see every day how they can deliver results. When you're boarding a plane, you see pilots working through a number of preflight checklists to make sure everything is in order and no steps are overlooked. At our fast-growing business, checklists that we continue to tweak are critical in building repeatable and scalable processes. Gawande sums it up well: 'You want people to make sure to get the stupid stuff right. Yet you also want to leave room for craft and judgment and the ability to respond to unexpected difficulties that arise along the way.' No matter how good the checklists, they themselves cannot make anyone follow them."</p>
